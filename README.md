# APIzza
Continuous deployment of pizza

Uses Zeit UI hooks to manage juggling user metadata and submitting pizza requests. Was intended to use webhooks and have a final POST to a Python lambda that calls the Domino's Pizza API. Progress deeply delayed by the fact that no one actually understood what a "lambda" was until about noonish on June 2nd, 36 hours into the thing, and then by the fact that securing user payment data is far easier said than done.
